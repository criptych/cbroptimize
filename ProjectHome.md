cbroptimize is a tool useful for optimizing cbr and cbz comic book archives for mobile devices (android,...). It resizes images inside the archive to a specified size, therefore reducing computing strain on the device to do the resizing itself. It can also decrease JPEG quality to reduce loading time on devices with slow processor.

Output of the program is cbz with no compression (further speed increase as the comic book reader doesn't need to decompress the archive).
